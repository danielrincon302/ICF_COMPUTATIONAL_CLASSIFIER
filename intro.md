# Introduction

Disability is a condition affecting more than one billion people worldwide, representing approximately 15% of the global population according to World Health Organization estimates. This reality transcends geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic boundaries, constituting one of the most significant challenges for contemporary public health and social protection systems. The way societies understand, assess, and respond to disability has evolved considerably throughout history, transitioning from purely medical models toward more comprehensive approaches that recognize the complexity of human experience.

In 2001, the WHO published the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), a revolutionary conceptual framework that transformed the understanding of disability worldwide. The ICF abandoned the traditional vision focused exclusively on deficit or disease, adopting instead a biopsychosocial model that considers disability as the result of the interaction between an individual's health characteristics and the contextual factors of their environment. This paradigm shift allowed recognition that disability is not a static condition inherent to the person, but rather a dynamic phenomenon influenced by multiple dimensions: body functions and structures, capacities to perform activities, participation in life situations, and environmental factors that can act as barriers or facilitators.

The practical implementation of the ICF in disability certification and assessment systems has proven to be a complex process. Multidisciplinary teams responsible for conducting these evaluations face the challenge of translating individual experiences into standardized qualifiers that allow objective characterization of each person's functional profile. This process, while necessary to ensure equitable access to services and benefits, entails inherent challenges related to interpretive variability, demand for specialized resources, and scalability limitations when facing growing populations.

The accelerated advancement of information technologies and, particularly, the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, have opened new possibilities for addressing complex problems in the health domain. Supervised classification algorithms have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for identifying patterns in clinical data, supporting diagnostic, prognostic, and decision-making processes across various medical specialties. This convergence between technological advances and the needs of disability assessment systems raises fundamental questions about how artificial intelligence could contribute to improving the precision, consistency, and accessibility of these processes.

The present work is situated at this intersection between international disability classification and computational machine learning techniques. It proposes to explore the feasibility of developing an automatic classification system that, using standardized ICF qualifiers as input variables, can predict both the disability category and the level of support required by each individual. This approach does not intend to replace the clinical judgment of specialized professionals, but rather to offer a complementary tool that contributes to the standardization of criteria and optimization of resources in certification processes.

The research starts from the recognition that any computational system applied to disability assessment must be grounded in deep respect for human dignity and the rights of persons with disabilities. The ultimate goal is not automation per se, but the construction of tools that facilitate timely access to the services and supports each person requires to develop their life project under conditions of equality. In this sense, the work aligns with the principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Sustainable Development Goals, which call for leaving no one behind in the pursuit of more inclusive and equitable societies.
